        A new note is added in the text field, and the user clicks the submit button.

        A POST request is sent to the server with note data.

        The note data is processed on the server and is previously stored in a database.

        The server sends a success message in the case of having a successful operation or an exception if something went wrong.

        The list of notes is updated with the new note.
